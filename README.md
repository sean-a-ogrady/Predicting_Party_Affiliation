This was done as a final project for AMS 325 (Computing and Programming Fundamentals in Applied Mathematics). The objective was self-defined -- our team wanted to 
predict political party affiliation in North Carolina based on demographic information using machine learning.

The data used in this project comes from the North Carolina State Board of Elections (https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data/voter-registration-data). We used the variables 
of age, race, gender, driver's licence status, and population density to predict whether or not an individual is a democrat. The machine learning algorithms employed 
were k nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and logistic regression. Results are discussed in the presentation in the repository.

When running this project, make sure all of the excel and python files are in the same folder. The libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn must be installed on 
the system. For Windows, the command "pip install" in the console should work. Alternatively, you can use jupyter notebook through anaconda which already has the 
required libraries.

Make sure to unzip the files within "data.zip" into the same folder as the Jupyter notebook file in order for it to run properly.

This code was written using Python version 3.9.15 as the interpreter.
